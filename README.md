1) Find the K item in the list
2) Get the number of list items without using size and length
3) Write the sequence check function for palindrometry (ex: 1 2 3 2 1)
4) Write a function to remove takes from the sequence. Set and analogs cannot be used
5) Write a distinctPack giving the result of the view (a unique sequence, a list with nested lists from duplicates)
(ex: input - [1, 3, 3, 2, 1] -> ([[1, 1], [3, 3], [2])).
6) Write your own slice(Option[StartPos], Option[EndPos]) implementation.
7) Write a function creating from a given sequence (any type)
all possible groups by N and only unique. (1, 2) and (2, 1) are considered equal combinations.
8) Write a function that outputs only prime numbers from a given range (Range).
